## Introduction

This code notebook provides a fully reproducible workflow for the paper **Playful iconicity: Structural markedness underlies the relation between funniness and iconicity**. To increase readability, not all code chunks present in the .Rmd source are shown in the output.

### Data sources

Primary data sources:

* *iconicity ratings*: Perry, Lynn K. et al. Iconicity in the Speech of Children and Adults. Developmental Science. doi:10.1111/desc.12572

         fun_resid_perc = ntile(fun_resid,10),

### Descriptive data

We have **4996** words rated for funniness, **2945** rated for iconicity, and **1419** in the intersection (set A). We have **3577** words with human funniness ratings and imputed iconicity ratings (set B). We have imputed data for a total of **70.245** words, and we're venturing outside the realm of rated words for **63.723** of them (set C). 

```{r numbers, echo=F}
words %>%
  drop_na(set) %>% group_by(set) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% kable()

```

The most important columns in the data are shown below for set A. Sets B and C feature `ico_imputed` and `fun_imputed` instead of or in addition to the human ratings. The field `diff_rank` is the sum of `fun` and `ico` deciles for a given word: a word with `diff_rank` 2 occurs in the first decile (lowest 10%) of both funniness and iconicity ratings, and a word with `diff_rank` 20 occurs in the 10th decile (highest 10%) of both.

```{r prelim_desc,echo=F}

words %>% 
  filter(set == "A") %>%
  group_by(diff_rank) %>%
  sample_n(1) %>% ungroup() %>%
  arrange(-diff_rank) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,ico,fun,logletterfreq,logfreq,rt,nmorph,diff_rank) %>%
  slice(1) %>% kable(caption="Structure of the data")

```

## Main analyses

### Funniness and iconicity

#### Reproducing prior results
Engelthaler & Hills report frequency as the strongest correlate with funniness (less frequent words are rated as more funny), and lexical decision RT as the second strongest (words with slower RTs are rated as more funny). By way of sanity check let's replicate their analysis.

Raw correlations hover around 28%, as reported (without corrections or controls) in their paper. A linear model with funniness as dependent variable and frequency and RT as predictors shows a role for both, though frequency accounts for a much larger portion of the variance (15%) than rt (0.6%).

```{r frequency_1, include=F}

# raw correlations at ~28% as reported (without corrections or controls) in E&T
cor.test(words$fun,words$logfreq)
cor.test(words$fun,words$rt)
``` 

To what extent do frequency and RT predict funniness?

```{r freq_2, include=F}
m0 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt, words %>% drop_na(fun))
summary(m0)

# model validation
plot(fitted(m0),
     residuals(m0))   # no obvious nonlinearity
qqnorm(residuals(m0)) # looks OK
qqline(residuals(m0)) # looks OK, slight right skew
vif(m0)               # below 2 so no indication of multicollinearity


```

**Model m0:** `r format(m0$call)`

`r print_table(m0)`

#### Known knowns

If frequency and RT explain some of the variance in funniness ratings, how much is left for iconicity? We'll do this analysis on the core set of 1419 words for which we have funniness and iconicity ratings.

Turns out that the magnitude estimate of iconicity is about half that of frequency, and with positive sign instead of a negative one (higher funniness ratings go with higher iconicity ratings). The effect of iconicity ratings is much larger than RT, the second most important correlate reported by Engelthaler & Hill.

```{r lm_1, include=F}

m1.1 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt, words %>% filter(set=="A"))
summary(m1.1)

m1.2 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt + ico, words %>% filter(set=="A"))
plot(fitted(m1.2),residuals(m1.2))  # no obvious linearity
qqnorm(residuals(m1.2))
qqline(residuals(m1.2))           # looks OK, slight right skew or light tailed as above
vif(m1.2)                         # all below 2 so no indications of multicollinearity

anova(m1.1,m1.2)
summary(m1.2)


```

**Model m1.1**: `r format(m1.1$call)`
`r print_table(m1.1)`

**Model m1.2**: `r  format(m1.2$call)` 
`r print_table(m1.2)`

`r kable(anova(m1.1,m1.2),caption="model comparison of m1.1 and m1.2")`

Partial correlations show 20.6% covariance between funniness and iconicity, partialing out log frequency as a mediator. This shows the effects of iconicity and funniness are not reducible to frequency alone. 

```{r partial_correlations,echo=F}

words.setA <- words %>% filter(set=="A")

pcor.test(x=words.setA$fun,y=words.setA$ico,z=words.setA$logfreq) %>% kable(caption="funniness and iconicity controlling for word frequency")

# the other two:
# pcor.test(x=words.setA$fun,y=words.setA$logfreq,z=words.setA$ico)
# pcor.test(x=words.setA$ico,y=words.setA$logfreq,z=words.setA$fun)

```

**Example words**

Both high: *`r words %>% filter(diff_rank > 19) %>% arrange(-ico) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`* 

Both low: *`r words %>% filter(diff_rank <= 2) %>% arrange(ico) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

High funniness, low iconicity: *`r words %>% filter(fun_perc > 9, ico_perc < 4) %>% arrange(-ico) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

High iconicity, low funniness: *`r words %>% filter(ico_perc > 9, fun_perc < 4) %>% arrange(-ico) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

N.B. controlling for frequency in these lists (by using `fun_resid` instead of `fun`) does not make a difference in ranking, so not done here and elsewhere.

What about compound nouns among high iconicity words? From eyeballing, it seems to be about 10% in a set of the highest rated 200 nouns. Many probable examples can be found by looking at highly rated nouns with multiple morphemes: *`r words %>% filter(set == "A", ico_perc > 8, POS == "Noun", nmorph > 1) %>% arrange(-ico) %>% slice(1:200) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% unlist %>% unname()`* (*zigzag*,  one of the few reduplicative words in English, is included here because the Balota et al. database lists it as having 2 morphemes).

### Funniness and imputed iconicity

Here we study the link between funniness ratings and imputed iconicity ratings.

```{r lm_2, include=F}

words.setB <- words %>%
  filter(!is.na(fun),
         is.na(ico))

m2.1 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt, words.setB)
summary(m2.1)

m2.2 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt + ico_imputed, words.setB)
plot(fitted(m2.2),residuals(m2.2))  # no obvious linearity
qqnorm(residuals(m2.2))
qqline(residuals(m2.2))           # looks OK, slight right skew or light tailed as above
vif(m2.2)                         # all below 2 so no indications of multicollinearity

summary(m2.2)
anova(m2.1,m2.2)

```

Compared to model m2.1 with just log frequency and lexical decision time as predictors, model m2.2 including imputed iconicity as predictor provides a significantly better fit and explains a larger portion of the variance.

**Model m2.1**: `r format(m2.1$call)`
`r print_table(m2.1)`

**Model m2.2**: `r format(m2.2$call)`
`r print_table(m2.2)`

`r kable(anova(m2.1,m2.2),caption="model comparison")`

A partial correlations analysis shows that imputed iconicity values correlate with funniness ratings at at least the same level as actual iconicity ratings, controlling for frequency (r = 0.32, p < 0.0001).

```{r pcor_2, include=F}
# partial correlation
pcor.test(x=words.setB$fun,y=words.setB$ico_imputed,z=words.setB$logfreq) %>% kable(caption="funniness and imputed iconicity controlling for word frequency")


```

**Example words**

High imputed funniness and high imputed iconicity: *`r words.setB %>% filter(diff_rank_setB > 19) %>% arrange(-ico_imputed) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

Low imputed funniness and low imputed iconicity: *`r words.setB %>% filter(diff_rank_setB <= 2) %>% arrange(-desc(ico_imputed)) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

High funniness and low imputed iconicity: *`r words.setB %>% filter(fun_perc > 9, ico_imputed_perc < 4) %>% arrange(desc(fun)) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

Low funniness and high imputed iconicity: *`r words.setB %>% filter(ico_imputed_perc > 9, fun_perc < 3) %>% arrange(-ico_imputed) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

What about analysable compounds among high iconicity nouns? Here too about 10%, with examples like *heartbeat, mouthful, handshake, bellboy, comeback, catchphrase*.

```{r analysable_compounds, include=F}
words.setB %>% 
  filter(ico_imputed_perc > 9,
         POS == "Noun") %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  slice(1:200) %>%
  dplyr::select(word) %>% unlist %>% unname() 

```

### Imputed funniness and imputed iconicity

```{r lm_3, include=F}

words.setC <- words %>%
  filter(is.na(fun),
         is.na(ico))

m3.1 <- lm(fun_imputed ~ logfreq + rt, words.setC)
summary(m3.1)

m3.2 <- lm(fun_imputed ~ logfreq + rt + ico_imputed, words.setC)
plot(fitted(m3.2),residuals(m3.2))  # no obvious linearity
qqnorm(residuals(m3.2))
qqline(residuals(m3.2))           # looks OK, slight right skew or light tailed as above
vif(m3.2)                         # all below 2 so no indications of multicollinearity

summary(m3.2)
anova(m3.1,m3.2)

# partial correlation
pcor.test(x=words.setC$fun_imputed,y=words.setC$ico_imputed,z=words.setC$logfreq)  %>% kable(caption="imputed funniness and imputed iconicity controlling for word frequency")

```

Model 3.1: `r format(m3.1$call)`
`r print_table(m3.1)`

Model 3.2: `r format(m3.2$call)`
`r print_table(m3.2)`

`r kable(anova(m3.1,m3.2),caption="model comparison")`

**Example words**

High imputed funniness and high imputed iconicity: *`r words.setC %>% filter(diff_rank_setC > 18) %>% arrange(desc(ico_imputed)) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

Low imputed funniness and low imputed iconicity: *`r words.setC %>% filter(diff_rank_setC <= 2) %>% arrange(-desc(ico_imputed)) %>%   dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

High imputed funniness and low imputed iconicity: *`r words.setC %>% filter(hum_imputed_perc > 9, ico_imputed_perc < 4) %>% arrange(desc(fun)) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

Low imputed funniness and high imputed iconicity: *`r words.setC %>% filter(ico_imputed_perc > 9, hum_imputed_perc < 3) %>% arrange(-ico_imputed) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>% slice(1:20) %>% unlist() %>% unname()`*

What about compound nouns here? In the top 200 nouns we can spot ~5 (*shockwave, doodlebug, flashbulb, backflip, footstep*) but that is of course a tiny tail end of a much larger dataset than the earlier two.

A better way is to sample 200 random nouns from a proportionate slice of the data, i.e. 200 * 17.8 = 3560 top nouns in imputed iconicity. In this subset we find at least 30 non-iconic analysable compounds: *fireworm, deadbolt, footstep, pockmark, uppercut, woodwork, biotech, notepad, spellbinder, henchmen, quicksands, blowgun, heartbreaks, moonbeams, sketchpad*, et cetera.

```{r compound_nouns, results='hide'}

words.setC %>% 
  filter(ico_imputed_perc > 9,
         POS == "Noun") %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  slice(1:200) %>%
  dplyr::select(word) %>% unlist %>% unname() 

set.seed(1983)
words.setC %>% 
  filter(ico_imputed_perc > 9,
         POS == "Noun") %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  slice(1:3560) %>%
  sample_n(200) %>%
  dplyr::select(word) %>% unlist %>% unname() 

```

### Structural properties of highly rated words

#### Log letter frequency

Mean iconicity and mean funniness are higher for lower log letter frequency quantiles:

```{r logletterfreq_1, echo=F}
words %>%
  filter(set == "A") %>%
  group_by(logletterfreq_perc) %>%
  summarise(mean_ico = mean.na(ico),mean_fun = mean.na(fun)) %>%
  kable(caption="Mean funniness and iconicity by log letter frequency quantiles")
```

High-iconicity high-funniness words tend to have lower log letter frequencies:

```{r logletterfreq_2, echo=F}
words %>%
  filter(set == "A",
         diff_rank > 18) %>%
  arrange(desc(ico)) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,fun,ico,diff_rank,logletterfreq_perc) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>%
  kable(caption="Log letter frequency percentiles for upper quantiles of funniness + iconicity")
```

Model comparison with funniness as the DV and log letter frequency as an additional predictor shows that a model including log letter frequency provides a significantly better fit. 

```{r markedness,include=F}

# m4.1 = m1.2, reproduced here for clarity
m4.1 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt + ico,data=words %>% filter(set=="A"))

# add logletterfreq as predictor
m4.2 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt + ico + logletterfreq, data=words %>% filter(set=="A"))

plot(fitted(m4.2),residuals(m4.2))  # no obvious linearity
qqnorm(residuals(m4.2))
qqline(residuals(m4.2))           # looks OK, slight right skew or light tailedness
vif(m4.2)                         # all below 2 so no indications of multicollinearity

summary(m4.2)
anova(m4.1,m4.2)

```

**Model m4.1**: `r format(m4.1$call)`
`r print_table(m4.1)`

**Model m4.2**: `r format(m4.2$call)`
`r print_table(m4.2)`

`r kable(anova(m4.1,m4.2),caption="model comparison")`

Partial correlations show that funniness rating and log letter frequency have a covariance of -15.7% controlling for iconicity, and that iconicity and log letter frequency have a covariance of -16.3% controlling for funniness ratings (all p < 0.0001 correcting for multiple comparisons). 

```{r pcor_34, echo=F}
#partial correlations 
pcor.test(x=words.setA$fun,y=words.setA$logletterfreq,z=words.setA$ico) %>% kable(caption="funniness and log letter frequency controlling for iconicity")

pcor.test(x=words.setA$ico,y=words.setA$logletterfreq,z=words.setA$fun) %>% kable(caption="iconicity and log letter frequency controlling for funniness")
```

Model comparison for combined funniness and iconicity scores suggests that having log letter frequency as a predictor significantly improves fit over and above word frequency and lexical decision time. 

```{r lm_combined_scores,include=F}
words <- words %>%
  mutate(funico = ico_z + fun_z,
         funico_perc = ntile(funico,100))
  
words.setA <- words %>% filter(set == "A")
m5.1 <- lm(funico ~ logfreq + rt,data=words.setA)
summary(m5.1)

m5.2 <- lm(funico ~ logfreq + rt + logletterfreq,data=words.setA)
summary(m5.2)
anova(m5.1,m5.2)

```

**Model m5.1**: `r format(m5.1$call)`
`r print_table(m5.1)`

**Model m5.2**: `r format(m5.2$call)`
`r print_table(m5.2)`

`r kable(anova(m5.1,m5.2),caption="model comparison")`

#### Structural analysis
We carry out a qualitative analysis of the 80 highest ranked words (top deciles for funniness+iconicity) to see if there are formal cues of foregrounding and structural markedness that can help predict funniness and iconicity ratings. Then we find these cues in the larger dataset and see if the patterns hold up.

This analysis reveals the following sets of complex onsets, codas, and verbal diminutive suffixes that are likely structural cues of markedness (given here in the form of regular expressions):

* onsets: `^(bl|cl|cr|dr|fl|sc|sl|sn|sp|spl|sw|tr|pr|sq)`
* codas: `(nch|mp|nk|rt|rl|rr|sh|wk)$`
* verbal suffix: `[b-df-hj-np-tv-xz]le)$`" (i.e., look for -le after a consonant)

We tag these cues across the whole dataset (looking for the *-le* suffix only in verbs because words like *mutable, unnameable, scalable, manacle* are not the same phenomenon) in order to see how they relate to funniness and iconicity.

```{r qualitative, include=F}

# words.high <- words %>%
#   filter(set=="A",
#          diff_rank > 18) %>%
#   dplyr::select(word,ico,fun,POS,logletterfreq,UnTrn,NSyll,NPhon,diff_rank) %>%
#   write_excel_csv(path="data/words_highest.csv",delim = ",")

# BTW, some versions of excel cope better with output from csv2
# write_excel_csv2(path="data/words_highest.csv",delim = ",")

# qualitative analysis of the top 80 words reveals the following sets of complex onsets, codas, and verbal diminutive suffixes that are likely structural cues of markedness:

onsets <- "^(bl|cl|cr|dr|fl|sc|sl|sn|sp|spl|sw|tr|pr|sq)"
codas <- "(nch|mp|nk|rt|rl|rr|sh|wk)$"
verbdim <- "([b-df-hj-np-tv-xz]le)$" # i.e., look for -le after a consonant

# tag words for these patterns, applying verbdim only to verbs
# add a cumulative measure of complexity
words <- words %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(diff_rank > 18,"highest","other")) %>%
  mutate(complex.coda = ifelse(str_detect(word,pattern=codas),1,0),
         complex.onset = ifelse(str_detect(word,pattern=onsets),1,0),
         complex.verbdim = ifelse(str_detect(word,pattern=verbdim),
                                  ifelse(POS == "Verb",1,0),0)) %>%
  mutate(cumulative = rowSums(.[c("complex.coda","complex.onset","complex.verbdim")])) 

# give a few examples of each
words %>% 
  filter(complex.onset == 1 & diff_rank > 18) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% unlist() %>% unname() %>% kable(caption="10 words with complex onsets")
  
words %>% 
  filter(complex.coda == 1 & diff_rank > 18) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% unlist() %>% unname() %>% kable(caption="10 words with complex codas")

words %>% 
  filter(complex.verbdim == 1 & diff_rank > 18) %>% dplyr::select(word) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>% unlist() %>% unname() %>% kable(caption="10 words with the verbal -le suffix")

# sanity check: all words ending in -le vs all verbs
#words[str_detect(words$word,pattern=verbdim),]$word
#words[which(words$complex.verbdim == 1),]$word

# compare these cues in the 80 highest rated words versus the rest
words %>%
  group_by(group) %>% drop_na(group) %>% drop_na(cumulative) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),
            ico=mean.na(ico),
            fun=mean.na(fun),
            onset=mean.na(complex.onset),
            coda=mean.na(complex.coda),
            verbdim=mean.na(complex.verbdim),
            cumul=mean.na(cumulative),
            sd=sd.na(cumulative)) %>%
  kable(caption="Markedness cues in highest rated words versus the rest")

# t-test & effect size
t.test(words[which(words$group == "highest"),]$cumulative,
       words[which(words$group == "other"),]$cumulative)

cohen.d(words[which(words$group == "highest"),]$cumulative,
       words[which(words$group == "other"),]$cumulative)

```

Model the contribution of markedness relative to logletter frequency. Model comparison shows that a model including the measure of cumulative markedness as predictor provides a significantly better fit (F = 52.78, p < 0.0001) and explains a larger portion of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.21 vs. 0.18) than a model with just word frequency, lexical decision time and log letter frequency.
  
```{r model_markedness, include=F}

# predicting fun+ico from markedness

words.setA <- words %>% filter(set=="A")

m5.3 <- lm(funico ~ logfreq + rt + logletterfreq + cumulative,data=words.setA)
anova(m5.2,m5.3)
summary(m5.3)

``` 

**Model m5.3**: `r format(m5.3$call)`
`r print_table(m5.3)`

`r kable(anova(m5.2,m5.3),caption="Model comparison of m5.2 and m5.3")`

Now we trace cumulative markedness in the imputed portions of the dataset, and do the same model comparison as above. 

First have a look at a random sample of top imputed words and their markedness:

```{r markedness_in_imputed, echo=F}
words %>%
  filter(is.na(ico),
         cumulative > 0,
         ico_imputed_perc > 9) %>%
  group_by(cumulative) %>%
  sample_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,ico_imputed_perc,ico_imputed,cumulative) %>%
  kable(caption="Cumulative markedness in a random sample of words from the highest quantile of imputed iconicity")

```

And at a random sample of words from lower quadrants and their markedness:

```{r markedness_in_imputed_1, echo=F}
# have a look at a random sample of words from lower quadrants and their markedness
words %>%
  filter(is.na(ico),
         cumulative > 0,
         ico_imputed_perc < 8) %>%
  group_by(cumulative) %>%
  sample_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,ico_imputed_perc,ico_imputed,cumulative) %>%
  kable(caption="Cumulative markedness in a random sample of words from lower quantiles of imputed iconicity")

```

Looks like random samples of 20 high-complexity words always feature a majority of high iconicity words:

```{r markedness_in_imputed_2, echo=F}
# random samples of 20 high-complexity words always feature a majority of high iconicity words
words %>%
  filter(is.na(ico),
         cumulative == 2) %>%
  sample_n(20) %>%
  arrange(-ico_imputed) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,ico_imputed_perc,ico_imputed,fun_imputed,cumulative) %>%
  kable(caption="Imputed ratings for 20 random words high in cumulative markedness")

```

Let's have a closer look at subsets. First quadrants, then deciles.
```{r markedness_in_imputed_subsets, echo=F}
# closer look at subsets
words.setB <- words %>% filter(set=="B")

words.setC <- words %>% filter(set=="C")

# compare four quadrants
words.setC %>%
  mutate(target_perc = ntile(ico_imputed,4)) %>%
  group_by(target_perc) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),
            onset=mean.na(complex.onset),
            coda=mean.na(complex.coda),
            verbdim=mean.na(complex.verbdim),
            complexity=mean.na(cumulative)) %>%
    kable(caption="Markedness cues across quartiles of imputed iconicity")

# or deciles
words.setC %>%
  mutate(target_perc = ntile(ico_imputed,10)) %>%
  group_by(target_perc) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),
            onset=mean.na(complex.onset),
            coda=mean.na(complex.coda),
            verbdim=mean.na(complex.verbdim),
            complexity=mean.na(cumulative)) %>%
  kable(caption="Markedness cues across deciles of imputed iconicity")

```

```{r markedness_in_imputed_lm, include=F}
# model comparison

# create funico_imputed measure
words.setC <- words.setC %>%
  mutate(fun_imputed_z = (fun_imputed - mean.na(fun_imputed)) / sd.na(fun_imputed),
         ico_imputed_z = (ico_imputed - mean.na(ico_imputed)) / sd.na(ico_imputed),
         funico_imputed = fun_imputed_z + ico_imputed_z)


m5.4 <- lm(funico_imputed ~ logfreq + rt + logletterfreq,data=words.setC)
summary(m5.4)

m5.5 <- lm(funico_imputed ~ logfreq + rt + logletterfreq + cumulative,data=words.setC)
summary(m5.5)
anova(m5.4,m5.5)
```

Comparison of models with combined imputed funniness and iconicity as a dependent variable shows that a linear model including cumulative markedness as predictor provides a significantly better fit (F1,19230 = 338.07, p < 0.0001) and explains a little bit more the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.11 vs. 0.12) than a model with just word frequency, lexical decision time and log letter frequency.

**Model m5.4**: `r format(m5.4$call)`
`r print_table(m5.4)`

**Model m5.5**: `r format(m5.5$call)`
`r print_table(m5.5)`

`r kable(anova(m5.4,m5.5),caption="model comparison")`

## Supplementary analyses

Here we report additional analyses that provide more details than we have room for in the paper.


### Analysable morphology bias in iconicity ratings

An inspection of the top few hundred words reveals many clearly iconic words, but also a number of transparently compositional words like *sunshine, seaweed, downpour, dishwasher, corkscrew, bedroom*. Looking at top rated iconic nouns with >1 morphemes is a good way of finding many of these.

```{r examining_ico_ratings, results='hide'}

# 200 most iconic words for visual inspection
words %>%
  drop_na(ico) %>%
  filter(ico_perc > 8) %>%
  arrange(-ico) %>%
  dplyr::select(word) %>%
  slice(1:200) %>% unlist() %>% unname()

# top rated iconic nouns with >1 morphemes is a good way of getting at many of these
words %>%
  drop_na(ico) %>%
  filter(ico_perc > 8,
         nmorph > 1,
         POS == "Noun") %>%
  arrange(-ico) %>%
  dplyr::select(word) %>%
  slice(1:200) %>% unlist() %>% unname()

```

These analysable compound nouns are treated by naïve raters as "sounding like what they mean" and therefore given high iconicity ratings, leading to rating artefacts. We can use data on number of morphemes from the English lexicon project (Balota et al. 2007) to filter out such words and look at monomorphemic words only.

The plots and partial correlations below show that the basic patterns emerge somewhat clearer in monomorphemic words, as expected. All findings remain essentially the same. 

There are **1278** monomorphemic words in set A (out of a total of 1419). 

```{r morphology, echo=F}

words.setA <- words %>%
  drop_na(ico,fun)

#### Markedness patterns in words with imputed ratings

While the primary focus of analysis 4 was on set A (the core set of human ratings), it's interesting to see how well the structural cues fare in explaining independently imputed iconicity ratings in the larger datasets.

#### Markedness for iconicity vs funniness ratings

Cumulative markedness is particularly good for predicting iconicity, rivalling funniness, word frequency and log letter frequency as a predictor of iconicity rating (model `mS.1`). It is less good for predicting funniness ratings, which are (as we know) also influenced by semantic and collocational factors (model `mS.2`).

```{r markedness_details, include=F}

mS.1 <- lm(ico ~ logfreq + rt + fun + logletterfreq + cumulative,data=words.setA)
summary(mS.1)

# much less so for funniness ratings, which are (as we know) also influenced by semantic and collocational factors
mS.2 <- lm(fun ~ logfreq + rt + logletterfreq + ico * cumulative,data=words.setA)
summary(mS.2)

```

**Model mS.1**: `r format(mS.1$call)`
`r print_table(mS.1)`

**Model mS.2**: `r format(mS.2$call)`
`r print_table(mS.2)`

#### Phonotactic measures from IPHOD
A quick look at a range of IPhOD measures shows that none of them correlates as strongly with iconicity or funniness as logletterfreq, so they don't offer us much additional explanatory power. 

N.B. IPhOD contains homographs, but frequencies are given only at the level of orthographic forms. To avoid duplication of data we keep only the first of multiple homographs in IPhOD, accepting some loss of precision about possible pronunciations. We use IPhOD's phonotactic probability and phonological density measures. Since we have no stress-related hypotheses we work with unstressed calculations. We work with values unweighted for frequency because we include frequency as a fixed effect in later analyses.

```{r iphodmeasures, echo=F}

words %>%
  filter(!is.na(ico)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(ico,fun,unsDENS,unsBPAV,unsPOSPAV,unsTPAV,unsLCPOSPAV) %>%
  ggpairs(cardinality_threshold=20) +
  theme_tufte()

```

```{r iphodmeasures_more, include=F}
# extreme ends of triphone probability
words %>%
  filter(!is.na(ico), !is.na(fun),
         (triphone_perc > 9 | triphone_perc < 2)) %>%
  arrange(triphone_perc) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,fun,ico,unsTPAV,triphone_perc) %>%
  group_by(triphone_perc) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(caption="Extreme ends of triphone probability")

# extreme ends of biphone probability
words %>%
  filter(!is.na(ico), !is.na(fun),
         (biphone_perc > 9 | biphone_perc < 2)) %>%
  arrange(biphone_perc) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,fun,ico,unsTPAV,biphone_perc) %>%
  group_by(biphone_perc) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  kable(caption="Extreme ends of biphone probability")


# extreme ends of phonological density
words %>%
  filter(!is.na(ico), !is.na(fun)) %>%
  arrange(-unsDENS) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,fun,ico,unsDENS) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>%
  kable(caption="Extreme ends of phonological density")

```

#### Valence helps explain high-iconicity low-funniness words

Valence is one reason for some iconic words not being rated as funny. Words like 'crash', 'dread', 'scratch' and 'shoot' (all in the lowest percentiles of valence) may be highly iconic but they have no positive or humorous connotation. In general, valence is of course already known to be related to funniness ratings: negative words are unlikely to be rated as highly funny.

```{r words-2, echo=F}
# words rated as iconic but not funny tend to be from lower valence percentiles
words %>% 
  filter(ico_perc > 8, fun_perc < 2) %>%
  arrange(-ico) %>%
  dplyr::select(word,ico,fun,ico_perc,fun_perc,valence_perc) %>%
  slice(1:20) %>%
  kable(caption="Valence percentiles for words rated as iconic but not funny")

```


#### Age of acquisition
Simon Kirby [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SimonKirby/status/1123602157322887169) whether the relation between funniness and iconicity might have something to do with child-directedness. This is hard to test directly (and unlikely to apply across the board) but if this were the case presumably it would also be reflected in AoA ratings — e.g., the more funny and iconic words would have relatively lower AoA ratings. (Importantly: we already know from Perry et al. 2017 that AoA is negatively correlated with iconicity: words rated higher in iconicity have a somewhat lower age of acquisition.)

We have AoA data for all 1.419 words in set A. It doesn't really explain the iconicity + funniness relation. That is, words high in both iconicity and funniness are not strikingly low in AoA. 

Though an important caveat is that this particular small subset may not be the best data to judge this on.

```{r AoA_check, echo=F}

# using AoA data from Kuperman et al. 2012
aoa <- read_csv("data/kuperman_2014_AOA.csv") %>% 
  plyr::rename(c("Word" = "word", "Rating.Mean" = "aoa"))

words <- words %>% 
  left_join(aoa) %>%
  mutate(aoa_perc = ntile(aoa,100))

# if iconicity+fun is explained by AoA we would expect diff_rank (where 2 = minimum ico & funniness, 20 = maximum ico and funniness) to show a pattern. In particular, higher deciles should show lower AoA. This doesn't seem to be the case: AoA hovers around 6-7 for every step.
words %>%
  drop_na(ico,fun) %>%
  group_by(diff_rank) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),mean.aoa=mean.na(aoa)) %>%
  kable(caption="AoA ratings for every decile of combined iconicity and funniness")

# and looking at all words learned until age 3.5, it's not predominantly the ones in the high-iconicity high-funniness quadrant
words %>% 
  drop_na(ico,fun,aoa) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ico,fun)) +
  theme_tufte() +
  ggtitle("Funniness and iconicity", subtitle="(all words learned until age 3.5 labelled") +
  labs(x="iconicity", y="funniness") +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5,na.rm=T) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data=. %>% filter(aoa < 3.5),
    aes(label=word),
    size=5,
    alpha=0.8,
    label.size=NA,
    label.r=unit(0,"lines"),
    box.padding=unit(0.35, "lines"),
    point.padding=unit(0.3,"lines")
  )
```

The sign of simple (uncorrected) correlations is positive for funniness (r = 0.1), but negative for iconicity (r = -0.07), so if anything there is not a unitary effect here (and the two cancel each other out). 

```{r aoa_correlations, results='hide'}

cor.test(words$fun,words$aoa)
cor.test(words$ico,words$aoa)

cor.test(words$diff_rank,words$aoa)

#### Word classes
Reviewer 1 asked us to look into word classes. We report this here as an exploratory analysis. The correlation between funniness and iconicity ratings has the same sign across word classes. The somewhat steeper correlation in verbs (*n* = 241) can be attributed in part to the verbal diminutive suffix *-le* (*n* = 17). 

```{r exploratory_POS,echo=F}

words %>%
  filter(set=="A",POS %in% c("Adjective","Noun","Verb")) %>%
  group_by(POS) %>%
  summarise(n=n(),mean.ico=mean.na(ico),mean.fun=mean.na(fun),
            raw.correlation=cor.test(ico,fun)$estimate) %>%
  kable(caption="Mean iconicity and funniness in set A across word classes")

words %>%
  filter(POS %in% c("Adjective","Noun","Verb")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(ico,fun,color=POS)) +
  theme_tufte() + ggtitle("Funniness and iconicity by POS") +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ POS)

words %>%
  filter(POS == "Verb",set=="A") %>%
  ggplot(aes(ico,fun,color=as.factor(complex.verbdim))) +
  theme_tufte() + ggtitle("Funniness and iconicity in verbs",subtitle="Teasing apart verbs with and without -le suffix") +
  labs(colour="-le suffix") +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
