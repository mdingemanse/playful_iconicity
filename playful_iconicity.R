# Iconicity and humour ratings -----------------------------------------------------------
# Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

# Motivation: Iconicity is closely allied to expressivity and playfulness
# (Samarin 1966, Dingemanse 2011).

# Prediction: iconicity ratings will be positively correlated with humor
# ratings, controlling for frequency.

# Outliers (words where ratings disagree most)

# Preliminaries -----------------------------------------------------------

# The relation is strongest for positive iconicity ratings:
ggplot(df %>% filter(iconicity > 0),aes(iconicity,humor)) +

# LME with orthographic length as a random effect shows that a model including

# Partial correlations

# There is 25.6% covariance between humor and iconicity, partialing out 
# frequency as a mediator.
pcor.test(x=df$humor,y=df$iconicity,z=df$freq_count)

# There is -11.2% covariance between frequency, partialing out 
# iconicity as a mediator.
pcor.test(x=df$humor,y=df$freq_count,z=df$iconicity)

# But no correlation between iconicity and frequency when partialing out humor.
pcor.test(x=df$iconicity,y=df$freq_count,z=df$humor)


# To do: look at words where the ratings disagree most
