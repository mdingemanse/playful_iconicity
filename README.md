# Playful iconicity
Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

People have feelings about the funniness of words. They can express these feelings in terms of word-level ratings. In a recent set of word-level norms, Engelthaler & Hills 2017 claim that these ratings are "not well predicted by existing norms". The highest correlations are between humor ~ frequency and humour ~ lexical decision RT. 

However, humor ratings do not occur in a vacuum: presumably subjects are using some information when judging how funny a word is. The most directly available information would be the phonological form of the word and the relation it presents between form and meaning. This leads to the prediction that measures that tap into that will be better predictors of humor than frequency and reaction time.

Prediction: iconicity ratings will be positively correlated with humor ratings, controlling for frequency.

The link between iconicity and humor ratings solidifies a relationship that has long been observed by linguists: the relation between iconicity and playfulness (Samarin 1966, Dingemanse 2011).
