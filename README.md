# Playful iconicity
Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

People have feelings about the funniness of words. They can express these feelings in terms of word-level ratings. In a recent set of word-level norms, Engelthaler & Hills 2017 claim that these ratings are "not well predicted by existing norms". The highest correlations they find are between humor ~ frequency and humour ~ lexical decision RT. 

However, humor ratings do not occur in a vacuum: presumably subjects are using some information when judging how funny a word is. Here I examine the relation between humor ratings and iconicity ratings. More details in [playful_iconicity.md](https://github.com/mdingemanse/playful_iconicity/blob/master/playful_iconicity.md).
