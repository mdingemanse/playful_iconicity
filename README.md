# Playful iconicity
Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

People have feelings about the funniness of words. They can express these feelings in terms of word-level ratings. In a recent set of word-level norms, Engelthaler & Hills 2017 claim that these ratings are "not well predicted by existing norms". The highest correlations they find are between humor ~ frequency and humour ~ lexical decision RT. 

However, humor ratings do not occur in a vacuum: presumably subjects are using some information when judging how funny a word is. The most directly available information would be the phonological form of the word and the relation it presents between form and meaning. This leads to the prediction that measures that tap into that will be better predictors of humor than frequency and reaction time. Specifically, *iconicity ratings will be positively correlated with humor ratings, controlling for frequency.*

The theoretical interest here is that people working on iconic words have long drawn attention to their expressive and playful nature. According to Fortune (1960), ideophones "bring a sense of ease and mirth". Welmers (1973) defines them as "those words which are such fun to use" and Samarin (1970) notes that ideophones "display a great deal of play with sounds". In my own fieldwork, I noted that "Mawu children may tease the white researcher living in their village by imitating his way of walking and by singing a song mocking his red skin (pɛ̃ɛ̃), small eyes (tsiritsiri), and pointy nose (miɔmiɔ) — all ideophones" (Dingemanse 2011:83).

If there is indeed a link between iconicity and the subjective funnyness of words, this solidifies a relationship that has has so far been based mainly on anecdotal observations and studies of relatively small numbers of words.
