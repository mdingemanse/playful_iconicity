# Playful iconicity
Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

People have feelings about the funniness of words. They can express these feelings in terms of word-level ratings. In a recent set of word-level norms, Engelthaler & Hills 2017 claim that these ratings are "not well predicted by existing norms". The highest correlations they find are between humor ~ frequency and humour ~ lexical decision RT. 

However, humor ratings do not occur in a vacuum: presumably subjects are using some information when judging how funny a word is. Here I examine the relation between humor ratings and iconicity ratings, under a simple prediction: *iconicity ratings will be positively correlated with humor ratings, controlling for frequency* (there are other relevant factors to control for which I skip over in this preliminary analysis).

The theoretical interest here is that people working on iconic words have long drawn attention to their expressive and playful nature. If there is indeed a link between iconicity and the subjective funnyness of words, this solidifies a relationship that has has so far been based mainly on anecdotal observations and studies of relatively small numbers of words.
