# Playful iconicity
Mark Dingemanse, August 2017

People have feelings about the funniness of words. They can express these feelings in terms of word-level ratings. In a recent set of word-level norms, Engelthaler & Hills 2017 claim that these ratings are "not well predicted by existing norms". The highest correlations they find are between humor ~ frequency and humour ~ lexical decision RT. 

However, humor ratings do not occur in a vacuum: presumably subjects are using some information when judging how funny a word is. Here I examine the relation between humor ratings and iconicity ratings, under a simple prediction: *iconicity ratings will be positively correlated with humor ratings, controlling for frequency*.

The theoretical interest here is that people working on iconic words have long drawn attention to their expressive and playful nature. If there is indeed a link between iconicity and the subjective funnyness of words, this solidifies a relationship that has has so far been based mainly on anecdotal observations and studies of relatively small numbers of words.
